# STR-Fewer-Labels Placeholder
Currently, we have not enough time for cleaning and uploading our code and consolidated data (will be available after checking license of all datasets), because we are preparing our next work for the next conference. 
Thus they will be updated in April or May, at least before CVPR2021 :)

We are almost ready to release code and preprocessed data. 
It takes some more days.
We are planning to release them on Jun 5 or 6.
Stay tuned :)
